We discovered that many of our peers feel depressed and like their minds stop working when they're struggling. They're hesitant to talk about their feelings because they think they're the only ones going through tough times. This sense of loneliness and despair sometimes leads to students hurting themselves or even thinking about ending their lives.

       <p>üìù We also conducted a survey to get community response for some sought after features listed below.</p>
