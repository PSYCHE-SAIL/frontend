PsycheSail is an app for students who need help with their feelings. It has a chatbot that talks to you and gives you ways to feel better. It also shows you fun things to do nearby on a map. You can join a group chat with other people who feel the same way as you. If things are really bad, you can talk to a counselor right away. It's all about helping you feel better and stay strong together. And the chatbot can even suggest music to help you relax.

We discovered that many of our peers feel depressed and like their minds stop working when they're struggling. They're hesitant to talk about their feelings because they think they're the only ones going through tough times. This sense of loneliness and despair sometimes leads to students hurting themselves or even thinking about ending their lives.
 </p>
       <p>üìù We also conducted a survey to get community response for some sought after features listed below.</p>
