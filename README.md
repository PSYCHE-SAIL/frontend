PsycheSail is an app for students who need help with their feelings. It has a chatbot that talks to you and gives you ways to feel better. It also shows you fun things to do nearby on a map. You can join a group chat with other people who feel the same way as you. If things are really bad, you can talk to a counselor right away. It's all about helping you feel better and stay strong together. And the chatbot can even suggest music to help you relax.

      <p>😓 
We discovered that many of our peers feel depressed and like their minds stop working when they're struggling. They're hesitant to talk about their feelings because they think they're the only ones going through tough times. This sense of loneliness and despair sometimes leads to students hurting themselves or even thinking about ending their lives.

       <p>📝 We also conducted a survey to get community response for some sought after features listed below.</p>

  <tr>
    <p>➡️ Along with building a progressive community, we realised that we could also provide a platform to increase awarness about opportunities and scolarships. We came to this conclusion after observing that a lot of our peers were either unaware or confused by things like Google STEP Intern/Generation Scholar, TalentSprint WE, International Research Opportuntiies etc. </p>
    <p>➡️ After a classmate faced a risky situation online due to limited knowledge about digtal security, we also decided to implement a Safety Section where our users can learn about best methods to be digitally secure and also access SoS features when needed.</p>
